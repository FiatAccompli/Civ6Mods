## Faster Roads v1.0.0

Changes the movement costs of roads in order to make the existence of roads (or lack
thereof) more impactful in the early game and to facilitate faster unit movement in the late game.

The base game of Civiliazation VI treats early game roads This is wildly inaccurate 
both from a gameplay perspective.

* Ancient roads cost 1 movement point per hex regardless of terrain.
* Classical roads cost 0.5 movement points (down from 1).
* Industrial roads cost 0.333 movement points (down from 0.75)
* Modern roads cost 0.25 movement points (down from 0.5)
