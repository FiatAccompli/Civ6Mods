## Faster Roads v1.0.0

A mod that changes the movement costs of roads in order to make the existence of roads (or lack
thereof) more impactful in the early game and to facilitate faster unit movement in the late game.

* Ancient roads cost 1 movement point per hex regardless of terrain.
* Classical roads cost 0.5 movement points (down from 1).  Additionally they are moved forward one era from the medieval era.
* Industrial roads cost 0.333 movement points (down from 0.75)
* Modern roads cost 0.25 movement points (down from 0.5)
