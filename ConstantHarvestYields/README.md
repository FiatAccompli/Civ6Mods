# Constant Harvest Yields v1.0.0

Do you:
* Find it unrealistic that a forest chopped down in 2000AD is somehow 10x as productive
  as the same trees given the axe in 2000BC?
* Wonder how harvesting half a dozen deer is as productive as a decade's output in a 
  modern city?
* Think that chopping is just too powerful?

If any of these are the case this might be the mod you're looking for!

In the base game, harvest yields scale linearly throughout the game based only on 
tech/civic progress. In this mod they're changed to be a fixed value. Yields from terrain 
harvests are 50 total food/production, which is roughly the same as harvesting in 
the middle of the classical era without this mod. Harvest yields for bonus resources 
are 100 food, 100 production, or 200 gold, which is roughly the same as harvesting 
in the middle of the medieval era without this mod.

As removing harvest yield scaling significantly reduces the use of Magnus' Groundbreaker 
promotion (+50% to harvest yields) (and, honestly, because I find that promotion rather 
overpowered and game warping) several changes are made to Magnus' promotion tree: 
* Groundbreaker promotion removed.
* New promotion Supply Chain Manager.
  * +1 production to industrial zone buildings with a regional production effect.
  * +3 range to the area of effect of industrial zone buildings.
* Surplus Logistics promotion is Magnus's initial promotion. 
  * Modified to only provide +1 food (down from +2) to trade routes ending in the city.

### Recommendation
As making harvest yields constant requires changing a global parameter that 
also affects district cost scaling it is recommended to also use a mod that changes how 
district costs are handled.  For example: [District Cost Rework](../DistrictCostRework)

### Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with all other mods. In particular, mods that add new 
resources will have constant harvest yields for those resources (although the amount 
harvested will be determined by those mods). However, as with any mod, unforeseen 
conflicts may occur.
