# Constant Harvest Yields v1.0.0

Changes harvest yields to no longer scale with tech/civic progress.  Yields from terrain harvests are fixed at a value that is roughly the same as harvesting at the middle of the classical era.  Harvest yields for bonus resources are fixed at a value that is roughly the same as harvesting at the middle of the medieval era.

As removing harvest yield scaling significantly reduces the use of Magnus' Groundbreaker promotion (+50% to harvest yields) (and because that promotion is rather op) it has been replaced with a new promotion: Supply Chain Manager adds +1 production to industrial zone buildings with a regional production effect and adds +3 range to the area of effect of industrial zone buildings.  As this promotion is not useful until the mid game the Surplus Logistics promotion is made Magnus's default promotion (but is nerfed to only provide +1 food to trade routes ending in the city).

*Note*: Because making harvest yields constant requires changing a global parameter that also effects district cost scaling it is recommended to also use a mod that changes how district costs are handled.
