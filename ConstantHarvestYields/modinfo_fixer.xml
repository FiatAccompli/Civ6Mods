        <xsl:with-param name="base">Changes harvest yields to be constant rather than scaling with tech/civic progress.  Yields from terrain harvests are fixed at a value that is roughly the same as harvesting at the middle of the classical era.  Harvest yields for bonus resources are fixed at a value that is roughly the same as harvesting at the middle of the medieval era.

As removing harvest yield scaling significantly reduces the use of Magnus' Groundbreaker promotion (+50% to harvest yields) (and because that promotion is rather overpowered) the following changes have been made to Magnus' promotion tree:
* Groundbreaker promotion removed.
* New promotion Supply Chain Manager.
  * +1 [ICON_PRODUCTION] to industrial zone buildings with a regional production effect.
  * +3 range to the area of effect of industrial zone buildings.
* Surplus Logistics promotion is now Magnus's default promotion.
  * Modified to only provide +1 [ICON_FOOD] (down from +2) to trade routes ending in the city.
    
[COLOR:255,128,0,255]As making harvest yields constant requires changing a global parameter that also effects district cost scaling it is recommended to also use a mod that changes how district costs are handled.[ENDCOLOR]</xsl:with-param>
