## Mods 
### Gameplay Mods
* [Constant Harvest Yields](ConstantHarvestYields) - Makes resource harvesting provide a constant yield boost rather than scaling with game progression.  Also replaces Magnus' Groundbreaker promotion.
* [District Cost Rework](DistrictCostRework) - Reworks district cost to be based on number of districts already built and city size rather than game (tech/civic) progression.
* [Faster Roads](FasterRoads) - Makes road movement faster.  That's all.

### UI Mods
* [Map Tacks +](MapTacksPlus) - It's map tacks, but with even more icon options.  What a plus!

### Modder mods
* [Mod Settings Manager](SettingsManager) - Provides an easy way for other mods to declare user configurable settings.
* [Settings Manager Example](SettingsManagerExample) - Provides a very simple example usage of Mod Settings Manager.
