A collection of civ 6 mods.

## Mods 
### Gameplay Mods
* [Constant Harvest Yields](ConstantHarvestYields) - Makes resource harvesting provide a constant yield boost rather than scaling with game progression.  Also replaces Magnus' Groundbreaker promotion.
* [District Cost Rework](DistrictCostRework) - Reworks district cost to be based on number of districts already built and city size rather than game (tech/civic) progression.
* [Faster Roads](FasterRoads) - Makes road movement faster.  That's all.
* [Unit Attrition](UnitAttritiion) - Units take damage every turn when they are not sufficiently close to a friendly city.  This significantly slows down the rate of map exploration.

### UI Mods
* [Global Hotkeys](GlobalKeyBindings) - Adds key bindings to control minimap size, volume levels, ambient time of day and toggle quick movement/combat.
* [Keyboard Navigation and Unit Action Hotkeys](MoreKeyBindings) - Allows you to navigate the world map with the keyboard and adds keyboard bindings for all unit actions.
* [Map Tacks +](MapTacksPlus) - It's map tacks, but with even more icon options.  What a plus!

### Modding mods
* [Settings Manager](SettingsManager) - Provides an easy way for other mods to declare user configurable settings.  Provides users an easy in-game UI to change settings.
* [Settings Manager Example](SettingsManagerExample) - Provides a very simple example usage of Mod Settings Manager.
